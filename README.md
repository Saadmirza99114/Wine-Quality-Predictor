## Getting Started
To run this project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required Python libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script: `python main.py`

## Data
The dataset used in this project can be found in `winequalityN.csv`. It contains various features related to wine composition and characteristics.

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps have been applied to handle missing values and ensure data quality. Columns with missing values have been imputed with the mean value.

## Model Training
We have employed multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Support Vector Classifier (SVC), to build predictive models for wine quality.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is assessed using metrics such as ROC AUC score and classification reports. The classification report provides detailed information about precision, recall, and F1-score for each class.
